Description: Pan-genome is the totality of genes found across members of a given group, 
  revealing the diversity and functional potential within that group. PAV(Presence-absence 
  variation) analysis is an essential step in pan-analysis.“Map-to-pan” is a common strategy 
  for eukaryotic pan-genome analyses. vPan is an efficient tool to explore and visualize 
  the complex result in PAV analysis. It provides four modules to display gene coverage 
  distribution, analyze and visualize PAV table, simulate pan/core genome sizes and find 
  phenotype associated genes.
